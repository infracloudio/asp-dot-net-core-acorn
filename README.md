## What is ASP.NET?

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-enabled, Internet-connected apps.

With ASP.NET Core, you can:
- Build web apps and services, Internet of Things (IoT) apps, and mobile backends.
- Use your favorite development tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Deploy to the cloud or on-premises.
- Run on .NET Core.

ASP.NET Core includes Blazor for building richly interactive web UI, and also integrates with other popular frontend JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, Vue, and Bootstrap. Blazor is a single-page app framework for building interactive client-side web apps using .NET and WebAssembly.
